Pgm Game System
IGS PGM

PGM System (c)1997 IGS

Description

A flexible cartridge based platform some would say was designed to compete with
SNK’s NeoGeo and Capcom’s CPS Hardware systems, despite its age it only uses a
68000 for the main processor and a Z80 to drive the sound, just like the two
previously mentioned systems in that respect..

Motorola 68000 processor, clocked at 20.000MHz, for main code
Z80 processor, clocked at 8.468MHz, for sound code.

Resolution is 448×224, 15 bit color

Sound system is ICS WaveFront 2115 Wavetable midi synthesizer, used in some
actual sound cards (Turtle Beach)

Later games are encrypted. Latest games (kov2, ddp2) include an arm7
coprocessor with an internal rom and an encrypted external rom.

Roms Contain the Following Data

Pxxxx – 68000 program
Txxxx – Text and background graphics (2 formats within the same rom)
Mxxxx – Audio samples (8 bit mono signed PCM at 11025Hz)
Axxxx – Sprite graphics data
Bxxxx – A Offsets and Sprite masks

There is no rom for the Z80, the program is uploaded by the 68000

Graphics Data

Text format:
8×8 16 color tiles
Each nibble represents a pixel
The low nibble is left pixel of the two.
(eg. 1000 0001 0100 0010 would be 1824 on the screen.)

Background format:
32×32 32 color tiles
The data is arranged in 32 pixel rows.
Each row of pixels is packed into 20 bytes.

Sprite format:
32 color packed three 5 bit pixels to 2 bytes (x333332222211111)
Sprites also include a mask of 8 pixels per byte, A 1 bit indicates an omitted pixel.
Pixels that are marked as omitted in the mask are not included in the pixel data, and are
skipped over on the screen.
Sprites can be any size (multiple of 16(?) pixels wide, but also need to allow 3 pixels to be packed into 2 bytes, or have the non existent pixels marked as omitted in the mask).

Text/Background map format:
— — Ffpp ppp- nnnn nnnn nnnn nnnn

n = tile number
p = palette
F = Y flip
f = X flip

Rom text tiles start at $C000.
Rom background tiles. Tile $0A00 = offset 65536 in T rom. This is based on:
$1A00 (Real tile number) * $280 (Size of each tile) – $400000 (Offset of game tile rom).

Text tile transparent color is 15.
Background tile transparent color is 31.
Text tilemap is 64×32
Background tilemap is 64×64

Palette format:
xRRRRRGGGGGBBBBB

Palettes:
0xA00800 0xA00FFF Background (32 * 2 bytes x 32 palettes)
0xA01000 0xA011FF Text (16 * 2 bytes x 32 palettes)

Scroll registers:
0xB02000 Background scroll Y register (WORD)
0xB03000 Background scroll X register (WORD)
0xB05000 Text scroll Y register (WORD)
0xB06000 Text scroll X register (WORD)

Sprites

Sprite table is located at 0x800000 – 0x800A00

Sprite data format:
XXXX Xxxx xxxx xxxx
YYYY Y-yy yyyy yyyy
-Ffp pppp Pvvv vvvv
vvvv vvvv vvvv vvvv
wwww wwwh hhhh hhhh

X = X zoom ($8000 is default)
Y = Y zoom ($8000 is default)
x = X position
y = Y position
p = Palette
F = Y flip
f = X flip
P = Priority
v = Sprite data offset / 2 (in B rom)
w = Width / 16(?)
h = Height

Huge update on “Hacked PGM Carts”

I have done alot of work today on hack carts….. I submitted dumps of the program roms to the Mame team.. as there not in mame at the moment….

I beleve the following is true….

ALL HACK carts run a PLD (seams to be a Lattice LC4128V On all of them).
PLUS a “ARM7” CPU. This is eigher in a a small QFP OR a PLCC 44pin chip.

“LPC2131FBD64” Is the QFP ARM7 Core.
I’m still ID’ing the PLCC part number (All chips are scratched off the top)

The PLD has JTAG.. i don’t know yet if the security bit is set…
The ARM7 seams to have jtag as well. (both have pin headers on the PCB for each chip).

SO it would seam they are emulating the IGS ASIC 27 chip…..

Another fact i know 100%. Some hack carts run un-encryted program rom code. While other use Encrypted Prog Roms.
