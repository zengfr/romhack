CPS1-sound-extract
This is a work in progress. Suggestions & pull requests are welcomed. Talk to me at @sf2platinum on Twitter.

Tools for extracting MIDI files and samples from CPS1 based arcade games.

cps1-extract-samples: Extract ADPCM samples for a game
cps1-extract-tune: Dump/extract stage melodies
I'm currently testing this against Street Fighter II (sf2ua) ROMs. I plan for these tools to be expanded to any CPS1 games that use a similar sound ROM, and ultimately an even wider range of arcade platforms.

I suspect most CPS1 sound ROMs will differ only in the tunes and samples, and the overall format of the stage tunes will be the same or similar. Please try different ROMs and let me know!

Installation
Requirements
Node.js
ROMs of games you want to work with
To install
Download or clone this repo, and cd to it
npm install # to get the dependencies
npm link # (optional - installs symlinks for the tools in your /usr/local/bin)
Examples
Run these commands from a directory containing the game ROMs

Dump Sagat's stage tune (number 11) from Street Fighter II World Warrior (sf2ua) to the terminal:

cps1-extract-tune sf2ua 11 -d

Export that tune to a MIDI file named track-11.mid:

cps1-extract-tune sf2ua 11 -m

Adding your own game
You'll need to figure out the addresses where songs, instruments and samples are stored. Have fun!

To get started, copy the games/sf2ua.json file, naming the same as the MAME romset name. Edit the hexadecimal values to whatever addresses you've discovered, and the names of the Z80 code ROM, and Oki sample ROMs. Put ROM names in a JSON array and they will be concatenated when read.

The format is documented in games/README.md

Digging around a CPS1 Sound ROM
The CPS1 uses a dedicated Z80 CPU for sound processing. Aside from sending commands to the Z80, the main m68k CPU doesn't interact with it at all. The Z80 intefaces with the Yamaha, Oki and m68k CPU with addresses beginning 0xf000.

The Z80 address map is:

Start	End	
0x0000	0x7fff	Z80 Code ROM
0x8000	0xbfff	Bank-switched access to bytes 0x8000-0xffff of the above code ROM
0xd000	0xd7ff	RAM
0xf000	0xf001	Yamaha YM2151
0xf002	0xf002	Oki MSM6295
0xf004	0xf004	Bank switch register
0xf006	0xf006	Controls pin 7 of the Oki
0xf008	0xf008	Sound command register from m68k CPU
0xf00a	0xf00a	Sound fade timer from m68k CPU
While the Z80 is a little-endian CPU, addresses of tracks and instruments are in big-endian format, requring byte-swapping when being read into Z80 register pairs. My guess is the tune programs were dumped from tools running on a big-endian Sharp X68000, and Capcom decided to do the endian swapping at run time.

CPS1 sound
The sound section of a CPS1 game is made up of

Yamaha YM2151 OPL3 FM Synthesizer for melodies
Oki MSM6295 for game samples and percussion instruments
A Z80 CPU to drive these chips.
The game CPU (m68k) sends 2-byte commands to the sound CPU. The first byte determines whether the commanded sound (or silence) will fade in/out. Some of these commands start songs such as stage tunes, others will play samples during gameplay.

YM2151
A very popular FM synthesis chip found in a range of arcade games, the Sharp X68000 computer Capcom used developing SF2, and some Yamaha Sythesizers. The YM2151 can play 8 channels of audio. Each channel consists of four operators which can be arranged in various ways to produce a variety of instrument sounds.

FM synth programming is quite involved, and the YM2151 is a complex chip. I plan to add more information here some day.

Oki MSM6295
The MSM6295 can play four channels of samples simultaneously. During a game, some channels are reserved for percussion instruments for the stage tune, other channels are kept free for game sound effects.

Sample ROM layout
The MSM6295 can map up to 256kiB of sample data.

Start	End	Description
0x0	0x7	Empty
0x8	0x3ff (max)	Address table, 8 bytes each sample for up to 127 samples
0x400	0x3ffff	ADPCM data
The address table can end (and the ADPCM data begin) before address 0x400. However, in SF2 the unused samples are all set to address 0xffffff.

Each 8-byte address entry consists of:

a 3-byte start address
a 3-byte end address
2 empty bytes
Look for the MSM6295 datasheet for more info.

ADPCM sample format
Two 4-bit samples are stored per-byte. The codec used is Dialogic ADPCM, and the sample rate is 8kHz (the MSM6295 also supports a 6kHz sample rate). This codec was also used in telephony equipment. The cps1-extract-samples tool can extract all of the samples in the Oki ROM automatically.

Helpful MAME breakpoints
Solo Yamaha channel
Mutes all yamaha channels except 0

temp0 = 0; bpset 2d3,b@d007 != temp0, {printf "muting channel %d", b@d007; a = 0x17; g;}

Conditional traces
Prints the loop counter each time a conditional branch instruction is encountered

bpset e8b, 1, {printf "branch type %02x voice counter %02x", b, b@hl; g;}

Yamaha register traces
Careful! It spews a lot of data!

bpset 69c, 1, {printf "Yama write reg %02x data %02x", d, e; g;}

Only Key commands:

bpset 69c, d >= 0x28 && d < 0x30, {printf "Yama KEY reg %02x data %02x", d, e; g;}
